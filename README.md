MiniTorch (https://github.com/minitorch/) is a *diy teaching library*
for machine learning engineers who wish to learn about the internal
concepts underlying deep learning systems.  It is a pure Python
re-implementation of the `Torch <http://www.pytorch.org>`_ API
designed to be simple, easy-to-read, tested, and incremental. The
final library can run Torch code. The project was developed for the
course `Machine Learning Engineering` at Cornell Tech.

To get started, first read :doc:`setup` and :doc:`contributing` to
build your workspace.  Then follow through each of the modules to the
right. Minimal computational resources are required.
Module starting code is available on GitHub, and each proceeds
incrementally from past modules.

Enjoy!
